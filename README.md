## Next.js App Router Course - Practicing Project

This project is created for practicing Next.js App Router, based on the starter template from the [Next.js App Router Course](https://nextjs.org/learn).
In this project, I will be experimenting with different features and modifications to deepen my understanding and application of Next.js.

## Project Objectives

To master the basic usage and concepts of Next.js.
To practice building web applications with practical functionalities.
To attempt implementing personalized feature extensions.

## My Modifications

Throughout the completion of the first eleven chapters of the Next.js App Router Course, I've not only acquired new skills but also tailored the learning experience to my interests and project requirements. Here's an overview of the customizations and enhancements I've made:

1. CSS Styling: Implemented styles with Tailwind, CSS Modules and clsx.
2. Optimizing Fonts and Images: Optimized fonts with next/font, and optimized images with Image Component.
3. Creating Layouts and Pages: Create the dashboard routes using file-system routing, created dashboard layout.
4. Navigating Between Pages: Enhanced the navigation experience using client-side navigation with next/link.
5. Database and Project Deploying : Create a Postgres DB to the project's data needs, deploy project on Vercel.
6. Fetching Data: Fetching data using React Server Components and SQL, using parallel to improve efficiency.
7. Static and Dynamic Rendering: Leveraged the benefits of both static and dynamic rendering to deliver content efficiently, utilizing Next.js's hybrid pages feature.
8. Streaming: Implemented streaming with loading.tsx and Suspense to avoid impact of slow data fetches.
9. Search and Pagination: Implemented a search function with real-time filtering and added pagination to manage data presentation in a user-friendly manner.
10. Mutating Data: Implemented data mutating with React Server Actions,
11. Error Handling: Created try-catch block with sql, handle error with error.tsx for all the pages, not-found.tsx for specific page.
12. Accessibility Improving: Implemented server-side form validation with useFormState hook, Zod and aira labels.
13. Authentication: Implemented authentication with NextAuth.js, protecting routes with middleware.
14. Metadata: Added page metadata like titles with Next Metadata API.

These modifications have not only solidified my understanding of Next.js's core principles but also pushed the boundaries of what I can achieve with the framework. By applying what I've learned in practical scenarios, I've managed to create a more engaging and performant application.
