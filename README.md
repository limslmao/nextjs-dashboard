## Next.js App Router Course - Practicing Project

This project is created for practicing Next.js App Router, based on the starter template from the [Next.js App Router Course](https://nextjs.org/learn).
In this project, I will be experimenting with different features and modifications to deepen my understanding and application of Next.js.

## Project Objectives
To master the basic usage and concepts of Next.js.
To practice building web applications with practical functionalities.
To attempt implementing personalized feature extensions.

## My Modifications
Throughout the completion of the first eleven chapters of the Next.js App Router Course, I've not only acquired new skills but also tailored the learning experience to my interests and project requirements. Here's an overview of the customizations and enhancements I've made:

Chapter 1 - Getting Started: Set up the initial project structure and ensured a solid foundation for the subsequent features.

Chapter 2 - CSS Styling: Implemented a custom CSS framework that aligns with the visual identity of the project, enhancing the user interface with a distinct look and feel.

Chapter 3 - Optimizing Fonts and Images: Optimized static assets to improve load times, including the implementation of modern image formats and font loading strategies.

Chapter 4 - Creating Layouts and Pages: Designed and developed a set of reusable layouts and pages, focusing on modularity and scalability.

Chapter 5 - Navigating Between Pages: Enhanced the navigation experience with animated transitions and proactive data fetching, making the page changes seamless and efficient.

Chapter 6 - Setting Up Your Database: Integrated a database solution tailored to the project's data needs, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

Chapter 7 - Fetching Data: Created a robust data fetching layer that handles server-side operations, client-side fetching, and caching mechanisms.

Chapter 8 - Static and Dynamic Rendering: Leveraged the benefits of both static and dynamic rendering to deliver content efficiently, utilizing Next.js's hybrid pages feature.

Chapter 9 - Streaming: Explored the use of streaming to incrementally deliver content, enhancing the perceived performance of data-heavy operations.

Chapter 10 - Partial Prerendering (Optional): Implemented partial prerendering strategies for optimal loading performance, ensuring critical content is delivered with priority.

Chapter 11 - Adding Search and Pagination: Developed a search functionality with real-time filtering and added pagination to manage data presentation in a user-friendly manner.

These modifications have not only solidified my understanding of Next.js's core principles but also pushed the boundaries of what I can achieve with the framework. By applying what I've learned in practical scenarios, I've managed to create a more engaging and performant application.
